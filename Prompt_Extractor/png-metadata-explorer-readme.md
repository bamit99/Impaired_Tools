# Stable Diffusion PNG Metadata Explorer

## Overview

Stable Diffusion PNG Metadata Explorer is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to easily view and extract metadata from PNG images generated by Stable Diffusion. This tool is particularly useful for artists, researchers, and enthusiasts working with AI-generated images who need to quickly access the generation parameters and other metadata embedded in their PNG files.

## Features

- **User-friendly GUI**: Navigate your file system and select PNG files with ease.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts and displays Stable Diffusion metadata from selected PNG files.
- **Prompt Isolation**: Separates the generation prompt from other metadata for easy viewing and copying.
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copying of the generation prompt to your clipboard.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing in any environment.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (requires Python).
